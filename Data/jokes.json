As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said,  \"Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!\"  It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.\"   I said, \"Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!\"  We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go.   She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table.  We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.  On the way back to the office, Jane said, \"You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?\"   I responded, \"I guess not. What do you have in mind?\"  She said, \"Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.\"  After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said,  \"Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.\"  \"Okay,\" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake.

The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, \"What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?\"   The young man replies, \"A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!\"   \"Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,\" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. \"Why does it cost so much?\"   \"Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!\" states the banker proudly.   The moped driver asks, \"Mind if I take a look inside?\"   \"No problem,\" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, \"That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!\"   Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster!   \"What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?\" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh!   He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!   The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, \"Oh my God!

After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist\u2019s face is a bloody pulp and thinks \u201cHe\u2019s so beat up at this point, he probably can\u2019t even feel anything anymore.

None of the apartments in this complex have air-conditioning. It's close to midnight, December in Sydney AUS, it's a hot humid night.   **Story:** With the heat and humidity I was finding it very hard to sleep, and had taken to watching some Japanese horror flicks on my laptop to kill some time. I had my headphones on since I needed to open all the bedroom windows (thanks to the heat) and I didn't want to disturb my neighbours. At a poignant part of the story in the movie, I could hear over the sound track a slow rhythmic masculine groan. After about a minute of confusion I realised that some of my neighbours were enjoying some casual coital union. The rhythmic groan picked up in frequency and amplitude, and was soon offset with his partners feminine \"yes\"es. Needless to say, I was no longer watching my horror movie and I was laughing hysterically, yet quietly, at this point into my pillow.  Quickly their coital activities got to a point of \"fever pitch\" where the male neighbour announced, \"I'm gonna cum, I'm gonna cum!\" to which the female neighbour demands he \"wait, and cum on my face!\". Cue a series of climatic groaning and other such sounds of affirmation.  Job done, the female announces that she's heading off to have a shower (good call) and goes to the bathroom to do so. All the windows are open it seems, as one can hear all the associated sounds of a shower hard earned.   Upon her arrival back into the bedroom the female scolds her counterpart for lighting up and enjoying a cigarette in her absence,  stating \"Dammit you know that ciggie smoke irritates my sinuses!\". Shortly after this statement, she sneezes loudly and impressively. At this point I turn towards my open window and say in a nice loud voice \"Bless you!\"...  ..Silence...  ...An embarrassed scream.  ...And a Guinness World Record attempt in the number of windows closed in the shortest period of time possible.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.   Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.   He made it out, but a single person died.   Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.   He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.   When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.   After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.   The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.  The man was perfectly fine.  Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.   And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.   Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.   Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.   The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.   For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.   After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.  The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.  Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.   And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.   To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.   And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.   On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.  \"You know what? No,\" said the executioner. \"I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.\"   Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.   The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.   The executioner was speechless.

No other children volunteer. Mr Trump searches the room. \"Isn't there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?\" Finally at the back of the room, little Johnny raises his hand. In a quiet voice he says: \"If a private jet carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens, that would be a tragedy.\" \"Fantastic!\" exclaims Mr Trump, \"That's right. And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?\" \"Well,\" says the boy, \"because it sure as hell wouldn't be a great loss and it probably wouldn't be an accident either.\""

There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!   It was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.   There were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.   She found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him.    They share a bottle of wine and continue talking and,   After awhile, she finds herself thinking,    'Oh my God! Maybe, this guy could be the one!   'Maybe he could be the future father of my children?'    She turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips.   He responds warmly.   They continue to kiss, the passion builds.   And he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom,  where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.  She is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.  After an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy,  they are lying there together in the afterglow. The woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly,   'Well, how was it?'   The guy gently smiles at her,  strokes her cheek,  looks deeply into her eyes,        and says:     'Help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf.'"

He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.  The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.  Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.  The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.  About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.  She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, \"Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you.  \"What do you mean?\" asked his wife.  \"Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in."

'Nah, I have problems with my shoulders and my back, that'd be such a painful thing to do day after day.'  So Satan opens the third door. In the room, they see Clinton lying on the floor, all tied up. Monica Lewinsky is lying on top of Clinton, giving him a blowjob. Bush stares at the scene with a wide smile and says:  'Ah, that I could endure!'  'Alright,' laughs Satan. 'Monica, you're free to go!'"

Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  \"So, you're a politician...\" \"Well, yes, is that a problem?\" \"Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!\"  \"Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??\" says the politician. \"Them's the rules\" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears... And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?  \"Open your eyes!\" says a voice. \"C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!\". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. \"Who are you??\" The politician asks. \"Well, I'm Satan!\" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. \"Welcome to Hell!\" \"Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?\" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. \"Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...\" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. \"It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!\" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... And is woken up by St Peter. \"So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?\" \"No sir!\" says the man. \"So then\" says St Peter \"you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on\". \"Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell\" says the politician. \"Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!\" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.  The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. \"What's this??\" He cries. \"Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???\"  \"Ah\", says Satan. \"You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...\""

I thought I had been assigned to a terrible place. The  very first person who entered my confessional told me he had stolen a television set and, when questioned by the police, was able to lie his way out of it. He had stolen money from his parents; embezzled from  his employer; had an affair with his boss\u2019s wife; had sex with his  boss\u2019s 17 year old daughter on numerous occasions, taken illegal drugs; had several homosexual affairs; was arrested several times for public nudity and gave VD to his sister in-law.  I was appalled that one person could do so many awful things. But as the days went on, I learned that my people were not all like that and I had, indeed, come to a fine parish full of good and loving people.\u201d  Just as the Priest finished his talk, the politician arrived full of  apologies at being late. He immediately began to make the presentation and gave his talk:  \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the first day our parish Priest arrived,\u201d said the  politician. \u201cIn fact, I had the honour of being the first person to go to him for confession.\u201d"

Within moments the priest manages to reel in the largest fish that the fisherman has ever seen. In the moment of excitement the fisherman exclaims, \"Look at the size of that Son-of-a-bitch!\"  Immediately the priest becomes disturbed and says, \"My son, please don't use such language.\"  The fisherman, embarrassed and hoping word of this gaffe will not reach the rest of his family, makes up an explanation in a moment of ingenuity, \"Oh no father, that's the name of that type of fish, a son-of-a-bitch.\" He lies, taking advantage of the priests fishing naivete.   The priest is pacified, and begs forgiveness for jumping to conclusions. The fisherman, relieved, brings the priest back to the docks and drops him off.  The priest lumbers back to the church, with the giant fish in his arms. Upon entering the church he sees the bishop and approaches him, \"Bishop, look at the size of this son-of-a-bitch I caught!\"  The bishop stands wide-eyed a moment, \"Priest, how could a man as holy as you use such language in the house of God?\"  The priest calmly explains that it is the name of the fish, and the bishop feeling embarrassed for jumping to conclusions offers to take and clean the fish for the priest.   After cleaning the fish the bishop takes it to the maid in the kitchen and tells her, \"Maid, I want you to cook this son-of-a-bitch for me.\"  The maid blushes and responds, \"Bishop, it may not be my place to say so, but is such language fitting for a man of your stature?\"  The bishop laughs haughtily, explains that it's the name of the fish and that he too had made the same mistake only minutes earlier. The maid laughs too, apologizes and cooks the fish.  It just so happens that the Pope decided to stop in for dinner at their church that evening. They are all sitting at the table when the pope says, \"Oh, my children, I know that gluttony is a sin but I simply can't stop myself from eating this fish. I must know, where did you get it?\"  \"I caught the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the priest.  \"I cleaned the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the bishop.  \"And I cooked the son-of-a-bitch.\" Said the maid.  For a moment the pope sat silently, staring at them all wide-eyed. He then slowly removed his hat, kicked off his sandles, put his hands behind his head, kicked his feet up on the table and said, \"You know what? You mother fuckers are alright!\""

She hasn't done the bedroom work herself for a long time, but she's sure she has said yes to everything a man could possibly ask for. She just has to find out what this man wants that has made her girls so angry. Besides she sees a chance to teach her employees a lesson.  So she goes over to Geoffrey and says that she's the best in the house and is available. She sits and talks with him. They frolic, giggle, drink and then she sits in his lap.
